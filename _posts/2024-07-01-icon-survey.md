<a href="https://www.iconcollege.ac.uk">ICON College</a> is an independent College of Higher Education in Central London. As a degree-awarding institution, they are required to submit an Access and Participation Plan to the Office for Students each year and have committed to surveying their students on an annual basis to gain insight into all aspects of their experience, with a particular focus on understanding the experiences of students from ethnic minorities and those with disabilities. 
<br><br>
The goal of this project was to analyse the surveys and create a dashboard that could be used by ICON management to delve into the data.

**The data** <br>
Responses to 84 survey questions by c.400 undergraduate students.

**Analysis** <br>
I cleaned the data using Excel and Python, then used Tableau to create an interactive dashboard for each over-arching questions of the survey.
